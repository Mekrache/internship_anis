# Project README

This README provides a comprehensive guide on deploying a 5G facility and an xApp using the 5G facility. The deployment process is divided into two main parts: setting up the 5G facility components and deploying the xApp.

## 1. Deployment of 5G Facility

In this section, we will walk you through the step-by-step process of deploying the 5G facility. The deployment involves several key components, including the NFVO (Network Function Virtualization Orchestrator), VIM (Virtualized Infrastructure Manager), Kubernetes API, Image Registry, SO (Slice Orchestrator), Web Portal, and the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack for log management.

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster up and running.
- Access to the necessary cloud resources for the VIM.
- Docker images for the components to be deployed.

### Steps

1. **Deploy NFVO in Kubernetes:**
   - Describe the steps to deploy the NFVO in the Kubernetes cluster.
   - Include any configuration files or commands needed.

2. **Deploy VIM:**
   - Explain how to set up the Virtualized Infrastructure Manager.
   - Detail the integration with the NFVO and Kubernetes.

3. **Set Up Kubernetes API:**
   - Describe the process of configuring the Kubernetes API.
   - Specify any authentication or access control requirements.

4. **Configure Image Registry:**
   - Provide instructions for deploying an image registry (e.g., Docker Registry).
   - Explain how to push necessary Docker images to the registry.

5. **Deploy SO Slice Orchestrator:**
   - Guide users through deploying the Slice Orchestrator.
   - Mention any dependencies or configurations required.

6. **Launch Web Portal:**
   - Explain how to deploy and access the web portal for managing the 5G facility.
   - Include information about user interfaces and login credentials.

7. **Set Up Logging (ELK Stack):**
   - Describe the process of deploying and configuring the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
   - Explain how to forward logs from deployed components to the ELK stack.

8. **View Logs with Kibana:**
   - Provide instructions for accessing Kibana to view logs.
   - Explain how to create visualizations and dashboards for monitoring.

## 2. Deployment of xApp Using 5G Facility

In this section, we will guide you through the process of deploying an xApp using the 5G facility that you have previously deployed. The deployment involves setting up FlexRIC gNB (Radio Intelligent Controller) and using the web portal to provide a Network Service Descriptor (NSD) to trigger the xApp deployment.

### Prerequisites

- 5G facility components deployed as outlined in the [Deployment of 5G Facility](#deployment-of-5g-facility) section.
- FlexRIC gNB deployment package or configuration.

### Steps

1. **Deploy FlexRIC gNB:**
   - Provide instructions for deploying the FlexRIC gNB.
   - Include any configuration settings and parameters required.

2. **Access Web Portal:**
   - Explain how to access the web portal provided by the 5G facility deployment.
   - Mention any login credentials or authentication methods.

3. **Submit Network Service Descriptor (NSD):**
   - Guide users through the process of submitting an NSD through the web portal.
   - Explain how the NSD defines the xApp and its requirements.

4. **xApp Deployment:**
   - Describe how the submitted NSD triggers the deployment of the xApp.
   - Explain any orchestration steps performed by the 5G facility.

5. **Monitoring and Management:**
   - Explain how to monitor the status of the xApp deployment.
   - Describe any management actions that can be taken through the web portal.

## 3. Deployment of iperf Server

In this section, we will explain how to set up an iperf server, which can be used for network performance testing.

### Prerequisites

- List any prerequisites for setting up the iperf server.

### Steps

1. **Step 1:**
   - Describe the first step of iperf server deployment.
   - Include any configuration settings or commands required.

2. **Step 2:**
   - Describe the second step.
   - Include any additional details or parameters.

## 4. Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed a 5G facility, an xApp using the 5G facility, and an iperf server. By following the steps outlined in this README, you've established a functional environment for testing and deploying 5G-related applications.

## 5. Additional Resources

- Provide links to relevant documentation for the deployed components, FlexRIC gNB, and iperf.
- Link to tutorials or guides for Kubernetes, NFV, ELK stack, xApp deployment, and iperf.
