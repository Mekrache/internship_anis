# Project README

This README provides a comprehensive guide on deploying a 5G facility, an xApp using the 5G facility, and an iperf server. The deployment process is divided into multiple parts, covering the deployment of 5G facility components, xApp deployment, and iperf server setup.

## 1. Deployment of 5G Facility

In this section, we will guide you through the process of deploying the 5G facility, including NFVO, VIM, Kubernetes API, Image Registry, SO Slice Orchestrator, Web Portal, and the ELK stack for log management.

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster up and running.
- Access to the necessary cloud resources for the VIM.
- Docker images for the components to be deployed.

### Steps

1. **Deploy NFVO in Kubernetes:**

   To deploy the NFVO, follow these steps:

   - Open a terminal and navigate to the NFVO directory.
   - Build the Docker image for NFVO using the following command:
     ```
     docker build -t nfvo-image .
     ```
   - Tag the Docker image with a version and a repository, for example:
     ```
     docker tag nfvo-image:latest your-registry/nfvo-image:v1.0
     ```
   - Push the tagged image to your Docker registry:
     ```
     docker push your-registry/nfvo-image:v1.0
     ```
   - Create Kubernetes deployment and service YAML files for NFVO, configuring the image pull from your registry.
   - Apply the Kubernetes configuration files to deploy NFVO:
     ```
     kubectl apply -f nfvo-deployment.yaml
     kubectl apply -f nfvo-service.yaml
     ```

   Make sure to replace `your-registry` with your actual Docker registry and adapt other parameters as needed.

2. **Deploy VIM:**

   To deploy the VIM, proceed as follows:

   - Open a terminal and navigate to the VIM directory.
   - Build the Docker image for VIM using the command:
     ```
     docker build -t vim-image .
     ```
   - Tag the Docker image and push it to your Docker registry:
     ```
     docker tag vim-image:latest your-registry/vim-image:v1.0
     docker push your-registry/vim-image:v1.0
     ```
   - Create Kubernetes deployment and service YAML files for VIM, configuring the image pull from your registry.
   - Apply the Kubernetes configuration files to deploy VIM:
     ```
     kubectl apply -f vim-deployment.yaml
     kubectl apply -f vim-service.yaml
     ```

   Remember to replace `your-registry` with your actual Docker registry and adapt other parameters as needed.

3. **Deploy Kubernetes API:**

   To deploy the Kubernetes API as a container, proceed as follows:

   - Open a terminal and navigate to the Kubernetes API container directory.
   - Build the Docker image for the Kubernetes API container using the command:
     ```
     docker build -t k8s-api-image .
     ```
   - Tag the Docker image and push it to your Docker registry:
     ```
     docker tag k8s-api-image:latest your-registry/k8s-api-image:v1.0
     docker push your-registry/k8s-api-image:v1.0
     ```
   - Create Kubernetes deployment YAML files for the Kubernetes API container, configuring the image pull from your registry.
   - Apply the Kubernetes configuration files to deploy the Kubernetes API container:
     ```
     kubectl apply -f k8s-api-deployment.yaml
     ```

   Remember to replace `your-registry` with your actual Docker registry and adapt other parameters as needed.

4. **Configure Image Registry:**

   Provide instructions for deploying an image registry (e.g., Docker Registry) and pushing necessary Docker images to the registry.

5. **Deploy SO Slice Orchestrator:**

   Guide users through deploying the Slice Orchestrator and configuring its dependencies.

6. **Launch Web Portal:**

   Explain how to deploy and access the web portal for managing the 5G facility.
   
7. **Set Up Logging (ELK Stack):**

   Describe the process of deploying and configuring the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for log management.

8. ... (continue with other deployment steps)

## 2. Deployment of xApp Using 5G Facility

In this section, we will guide you through the process of deploying an xApp using the 5G facility.

### Prerequisites

- 5G facility components deployed as outlined in the "Deployment of 5G Facility" section.
- FlexRIC gNB deployment package or configuration.

### Steps

1. **Deploy FlexRIC gNB:**

   Provide instructions for deploying the FlexRIC gNB and its configuration.

2. **Access Web Portal:**

   Explain how to access the web portal provided by the 5G facility deployment.

3. **Submit Network Service Descriptor (NSD):**

   Guide users through the process of submitting an NSD through the web portal to trigger the xApp deployment.

4. **xApp Deployment:**

   Describe how the submitted NSD triggers the deployment of the xApp.

5. **Monitoring and Management:**

   Explain how to monitor the status of the xApp deployment and manage its lifecycle.

## 3. Deployment of iperf Server

In this section, we will explain how to set up an iperf server for network performance testing.

### Prerequisites

- List any prerequisites for setting up the iperf server.

### Steps

1. **Step 1:**

   Describe the first step of iperf server deployment.
   
2. **Step 2:**

   Describe the second step of iperf server deployment.

## 4. Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed a 5G facility, an xApp using the 5G facility, and an iperf server. By following the steps outlined in this README, you've established a functional environment for testing and deploying 5G-related applications.

## 5. Additional Resources
